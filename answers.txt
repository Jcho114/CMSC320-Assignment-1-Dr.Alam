Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: For robust versioning of software that
not only eases personal development but also
facilitates collaborative development.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to?
Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data Science could be applied to Machine
Learning. For example, developing robust models
require high quality data for training and testing.
Considerations such as data cleaning, sampling, and
whatnot all stem from data science, thus making
it applicable for this field of work.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging is directly comparing the latest
commit of one branch to the other. We are essentially
creating a new commit that resolves any differences
found from these two branches. Meanwhile, rebasing
takes a completely different approach where they
first find the point in which both branches diverge.
From there, we incrementally check each commit of
one of the branches to the latest commit of the other
branch, resolving any conflicts as they come by.
In the end, we should expect to see commits from both
branches included in the git logs.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve my mathematical and statistical
base as well as get adept at data science conventions.
I have spent most of my short 2 year cs career working
with SWE. I wish to now extend to ML and I believe this
class will be a great first step. Of course, I have been
doing lots of self study, but it is great to have a steady
option in the form of a class with deadlines, grades, etc.
